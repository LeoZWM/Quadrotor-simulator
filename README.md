This quadrotor simulator is build in MATLAB upon the foundation of another fixed wing simulator stored in repository https://github.com/stan-lu/Fixed-wing-simulator. It also makes use of the skeleton code provided by [1]. I modified it to achieve the goal of performing cooperative monitoring formation, of which the code cannot be provided because a patent about it is under reviewed by now.
